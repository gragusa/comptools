More precisely, given a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^{k}\\to \\mathbb{R}\\), we seek \\(x^{*}\\in\\mathcal{C}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{k}\\) such that \\[\nf(x^{*}) \\leqslant f(x) \\text{ for all }x\\in\\mathcal{C}.\n\\] The set \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) constraints the solution to leave in a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{k}\\)\nWhen \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) coincides with \\(\\mathbb{R}^k\\) the problem is said to be unconstrained.\nIn unconstrained optimization, the objective function \\(f(x)\\) needs to be minimized (or maximized) without any restrictions on the variable \\(x\\). The problem is described as \\[\n\\min_{x} f(x), \\quad x\\in\\mathbb{R}^k.\n\\]\nMany problems involve constraints that the solution must satisfy, that is, \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) does not coincide with \\(\\mathbb{R}^k\\). For instance, we want to minimize the function over a space where \\(x_j &lt; c_j\\), \\(c_j\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(j=1,\\ldots,k\\) or we may be interested in values of \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(f\\) when certain restrictions are satisfied. Generally, the constrained optimization is \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   &\\min_{x} \\ f(x) \\\\\n   &\\text{subject to} \\\\\n   & \\ g_i(x) \\leq 0, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, m, \\\\\n                     & \\ h_j(x) = 0, \\quad j = 1, \\ldots, p.\n   \\end{aligned}\n\\] Here, \\(g_i(x)\\) and \\(h_j(x)\\) are functions that represent inequality and equality constraints.\nIn what follows, we will focus on the class of unconstrained problems where \\(f\\) is smooth, that is, a function that everywhere continuously differentiable."

Consider the function plotted in Figure 1. We start the algorithm at \\(x^{(0)}\\). The derivative at this point (the tangent line in blue) is positive, that is, \\(f'(x^{(0)})&gt;0\\). Thus, to descend toward smaller values of the function have to set a point \\(x^{(1)}\\) smaller. One possibility is to use the following iteration \\[\nx^{(1)} = x^{(0)} - \\alpha \\nabla f(x^{(0)}),\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\in(0,1)\\) is the step size. As it can be seen from Figure 1, at this point the value of \\(f\\) is now lower. Applying a new iterate we obtain \\(x^{(2)} = x^{(1)} - \\alpha f'(x^{(1)})\\) which is now very close to the minimum value of the function.\nWe will keep iterating until the termination condition is satisfied. The termination condition will be satisfied when the current iterate is likely to be a local minimum.[^termination]\n3: The most common termination conditions are 1. Maximum iterations. We may want to terminate when the number of iterations \\(k\\) exceeds some threshold \\(k_max\\). Alternatively, we might want to terminate once a maximum amount of elapsed time is exceeded. 2. Absolute improvement. This termination condition looks at the change in the function value over subsequent steps. If the change is smaller than a given threshold, it will terminate: \\[\nf(x^{(k)}) - f(x^{(r+1)}) &lt; \\epsilon_a\n\\] 1. Relative improvement. This termination condition looks at the change in function value but uses the relative change of the function. The iterations will terminate if \\[\nf(x^{(k)}) - f(x^{(r+1)}) &lt; \\epsilon_r|f(x^{(k)})|\n\\] 1. Gradient magnitude. We can terminate if the derivative is smaller than a certain tolerance \\[\n\\Vert \\delta f(x^{(k)}) \\Vert &lt; \\epsilon_g\n\\]\nThe same logic can be applied to the case in which \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^k \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) the only difference is that now \\(\\nabla f(x^{(0)})\\) is a \\(k\\times 1\\) vector instead of being a scalar.\nThe gradient descent idea can be generalized by considering the following iterate \\[\nx^{(r)} = x^{(r-1)} - \\alpha d^{(r)},\n\\] where \\(d^{(r)}\\) is a descent direction. The idea of this generalization is that instead of using the gradient as direction, we can use different directions that might speed up the algorithm.\nWhen \\(d^{(r)} = \\nabla f(x^{(r)})\\), the algorithm is called the gradient descent (and direction is called the direction of deepest descent).\nDirections that can be used belong to two classes: 1. first-order: the direction only uses information about the gradient of \\(f\\). The many variations of the gradient descent (Ada, Momentum, etc.) and the conjugate gradient method belong to this class. 2. second order: the direction incorporate information about the second derivatives of \\(f\\). The key idea here is that \\[\nf(x^{(r+1)}) = f(x^{(r)}) + \\nabla f'(x^{(r)})(x^{(r+1)}-x^{(r)}) + (x^{(r+1)}-x^{(r)}) \\dot{H}_k (x^{(r+1)}-x^{(r)}),\n\\] where \\(\\dot{H}_k = \\nabla^2 f(\\dot{x}^{(r)})\\) is the Hessian evaluated at some point between \\(x^{(r+1)}\\) and \\(x^{(r)}\\). Then, approximating the gradient of \\(f\\) and setting it equal to zero yields \\[\nx^{(r+1)} = x^{(r)}-[\\nabla^2 f(x^{(r)})]^{-1} \\nabla f(x^{(r)}) +\n\\] which suggests using the inverse of the hessian to form the direction. Since evaluating the Hessian at each iterate is too costly computationally, different algorithms approximate the Hessian in different ways."

AD exploits the fact that any computer program, no matter how complex, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations and functions (like additions, multiplications, and trigonometric functions). By applying the chain rule to these operations, AD efficiently computes derivatives of arbitrary order, which are accurate up to machine precision. This contrasts with numerical differentiation, which can introduce significant rounding errors.\nOne popular Python library that implements automatic differentiation is autograd. It extends the capabilities of NumPy by allowing you to automatically compute derivatives of functions composed of many standard mathematical operations. Here is a simple example of using autograd to compute the derivative of a function:\nNow, let’s compute the derivative of the function defined above.\n\nimport autograd.numpy as np   # Import wrapped NumPy\nfrom autograd import grad    # Import the gradient function\n\n# Create a function that returns the derivative of f\ndf = grad(f)\n\n# Evaluate the derivative at x = pi\nprint(\"The derivative of f(x) at x = [0.2, 0.1] is:\", df(np.array([0.2, 0.1])))\n\nThe derivative of f(x) at x = [0.2, 0.1] is: [-5.6 -5.8]\n\n\nWhen comparing the precision and applicability of finite difference methods and automatic differentiation (AD), especially for functions with large input dimensions, there are several key points to consider.\nFinite difference methods approximate derivatives by evaluating differences in function values at nearby points. The accuracy of these methods is highly dependent on the step size chosen: too large, and the approximation becomes poor; too small, and floating-point errors can dominate the result. This trade-off can be particularly challenging in high-dimensional spaces as errors can accumulate more significantly (each partial derivative may introduce errors that affect the overall gradient computation).\nAD computes derivatives using the exact chain rule and is not based on numerical approximations of difference quotients. Therefore, it can provide derivatives that are accurate to machine precision. AD efficiently handles computations in high dimensions because it systematically applies elementary operations and chain rules, bypassing the curse of dimensionality that often affects finite difference methods. AD is less sensitive to the numerical issues that affect finite differences, such as choosing a step size or dealing with subtractive cancellation.\nThe visualization provided by @fig-error demonstrates the comparative performance of the finite difference method and automatic differentiation (AD) when used to calculate gradients. This graph illustrates a key observation: as the dimensionality of the input increases, the error associated with the finite difference method tends to rise almost linearly. This escalation in error is accompanied by an increase in computation time, underscoring the method’s sensitivity to higher dimensions.\nIn contrast, the automatic differentiation method showcases remarkable stability across dimensions. The error remains negligible, essentially zero, highlighting AD’s inherent precision. Furthermore, AD’s computation time remains consistent regardless of input dimensionality. This performance characteristic of AD is due to its methodological approach, which systematically applies the chain rule to derive exact derivatives, bypassing the numerical instability and scaling issues often encountered with finite differences.\nThese insights are particularly relevant in fields that rely heavily on precise and efficient computation of derivatives, such as in numerical optimization, machine learning model training, and dynamic systems simulation. The stability and scalability of AD make it an invaluable tool in these areas, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data sets or complex models.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\n\ndef multivariate_function(x):\n    \"\"\" A sample multivariate function, sum of squares plus sin of each component. \"\"\"\n    return np.sum(x**2 + np.sin(x))\n\ndef analytical_derivative(x):\n    \"\"\" Analytical derivative of the multivariate function. \"\"\"\n    return 2*x + np.cos(x)\n\ndef finite_difference_derivative(f, x, h=1e-5):\n    \"\"\" Compute the gradient of `f` at `x` using the central finite difference method. \"\"\"\n    grad = np.zeros_like(x)\n    for i in range(len(x)):\n        x_plus = np.copy(x)\n        x_minus = np.copy(x)\n        x_plus[i] += h\n        x_minus[i] -= h\n        grad[i] = (f(x_plus) - f(x_minus)) / (2*h)\n    return grad\n\n# Range of dimensions\ndimensions = range(1, 101)\nerrors = []\ntimes = []\n\n# Loop over dimensions\nfor dim in dimensions:\n    x = np.random.randn(dim)\n    \n    # Analytical derivative\n    true_grad = analytical_derivative(x)\n    \n    # Start timing\n    start_time = time.time()\n    \n    # Finite difference derivative\n    fd_grad = finite_difference_derivative(multivariate_function, x)\n    \n    # End timing\n    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\n    times.append(elapsed_time)\n    \n    # Error\n    error = np.linalg.norm(fd_grad - true_grad)\n    errors.append(error)\n\n# Plotting error\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.plot(dimensions, errors, marker='o')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Dimensions')\nplt.ylabel('Error')\nplt.title('Approximation Error by Dimension')\nplt.grid(True)\n\n# Plotting computational time\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.plot(dimensions, times, marker='o')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Dimensions')\nplt.ylabel('Time (seconds)')\nplt.title('Computational Time by Dimension')\nplt.grid(True)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing solver\nIt is almost always advantageous to utilize established minimization routines and libraries rather than crafting custom code from scratch. This approach not only saves time but also leverages the extensive testing and optimizations embedded within these libraries, which are designed to handle a broad range of mathematical challenges efficiently and accurately.\nIn Python, the scipy.optimize module from the SciPy library is a robust toolkit that provides several algorithms for function minimization, including methods for unconstrained and constrained optimization. Some of the notable algorithms include BFGS, Nelder-Mead, and conjugate gradient, among others. These algorithms are well-suited for numerical optimization in scientific computing.\nIn Julia, Optim.jl offers a similar breadth of optimization routines, with support for a variety of optimization problems, from simple univariate function minimization to complex multivariate cases. Optim.jl includes algorithms like L-BFGS, Gradient Descent, and Newton’s Method, each tailored for specific types of optimization scenarios.\nBoth Python’s SciPy and Julia’s Optim.jl represent just a slice of the available tools. There are many other solvers and libraries dedicated to optimization. The most widely used is Ipopt which is particularly useful for problems that require embedding in lower-level systems for performance.\nThe choice of a solver can depend on several factors:\n\nProblem Type: Some solvers are better suited for large-scale problems, others for problems with complex constraints, or for nondifferentiable or noisy functions.\nAccuracy and Precision: Different algorithms and implementations can provide varying levels of precision and robustness, important in applications like aerospace or finance.\nPerformance and Speed: Depending on the implementation, some solvers might be optimized for speed using advanced techniques like parallel processing or tailored data structures.\nEase of Use and Flexibility: Some libraries offer more user-friendly interfaces and better documentation, which can be crucial for less experienced users or complex projects where customization is key.\n\n\n\nJulia’s Optim.jl\nOptim.jl supports various optimization algorithms. For our simple example, we can use the BFGS method, which is suitable for smooth functions and is part of a family of quasi-Newton methods.\nYou can now call the optimize function from Optim.jl, specifying the function, an initial guess, and the optimization method. Here is how you do it:\n# Initial guess\ninitial_guess = [0.0, 0.0]\n\n# Perform the optimization\nresult = optimize(f, initial_guess, BFGS())\nThe result object contains all the information about the optimization process, including the optimal values found, the value of the function at the optimum, and the convergence status:\n# Access the results\nprintln(\"Optimal parameters: \", Optim.minimizer(result))\nprintln(\"Minimum value: \", Optim.minimum(result))\nprintln(\"Convergence information: \", result)\nIf your function is more complex or if you want to speed up the convergence for large-scale problems, you can also provide the gradient (and even the Hessian) to the optimizer. Optim.jl can utilize these for more efficient calculations.\nFor constrained optimization, Optim.jl has support for simple box constraints which can be set using the Fminbox method to wrap around other methods like BFGS.\n# Define the bounds\nlower_bounds = [0.5, 1.5]\nupper_bounds = [1.5, 2.5]\n\n# Initial guess within the bounds\ninitial_guess = [1.0, 2.0]\n\n# Set up the optimizer with Fminbox\noptimizer = Fminbox(BFGS())\n# Run the optimization with bounds\nresult = optimize(f, lower_bounds, upper_bounds, initial_guess, optimizer, Optim.Options(g_tol = 1e-6))"

    "text": "Forecasting in Time Series\nForecasting in time series analysis involves using historical data to predict future values. The objective is to model the conditional expectation of a time series based on past observations.\n\nDirect Forecasts\nDirect forecasting involves modeling the target variable directly at the desired forecast horizon. Unlike iterative approaches, which forecast one step ahead and then use those forecasts as inputs for subsequent steps, direct forecasting directly models the relationship between past observations and future value.\n\n\nARX Models\nAutoregressive Moving with predictors (ARX) models are a class of univariate time series models that extend ARMA models by incorporating exogenous (independent) variables. These models are formulated as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{t+h} &=  \\alpha + \\phi_0 Y_t + \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p Y_{t-p} + \\theta_{0,1} X_{t,1} + \\theta_{1,1} X_{t-1,1} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,1} X_{t-p,1} + \\dots + \\theta_{0,k} X_{t,k} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,k} X_{t-p,k} + u_{t+h}\\\\\n        &=  \\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^p \\phi_i Y_{t-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^k\\sum_{s=0}^p \\theta_{s,j} X_{t-s,j} + \\epsilon_{t+h}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\\(Y_{t+h}\\): The target variable at time \\(t+h\\).\n\\(X_{t,j}\\): Predictors (variable \\(j=1,\\ldots,k\\) at time \\(t\\)).\n\\(p\\) number of lags of the target and the predictors.1\n\\(\\phi_i\\), \\(i=0,\\dots,p\\), and \\(\\theta_{j,s}\\), \\(j=1,\\dots,k\\), \\(s=1,\\ldots,r\\): Parameters of the model.\n\\(\\epsilon_{t+h}\\): error term.\n\nFor instance, to predict Industrial Prediction using as predictor inflation and the 3-month t-bill, the target variable is INDPRO, and the predictors are CPIAUSL and TB3MS. Notice that the target and the predictors are the transformed variables. Thus, if we use INDPRO as the target, we are predicting the log-difference of industrial production, which is a good approximation for its month-to-month percentage change.\nBy convention, the data ranges from \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\), where \\(T\\) is the last period, we have data (for the df_cleaned dataset, \\(T\\) corresponds to January 2024).\n\n\nForecasting with ARX\nSuppose that we know the parameters of the model for the moment. To obtain a forecast for \\(Y_{T+h}\\), the \\(h\\)-step ahead forecast, we calculate \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{Y}_{T+h} &=  \\alpha + \\phi_0 Y_T + \\phi_1 Y_{T-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p Y_{T-p} \\\\\n                  &\\,\\,\\quad \\quad + \\theta_{0,1} X_{T,1} + \\theta_{1,1} X_{T-1,1} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,1} X_{T-p,1} \\\\\n                  &\\,\\,\\quad \\quad + \\dots + \\theta_{0,k} X_{T,k} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,k} X_{T-p,k}\\\\\n        &=  \\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^p \\phi_i Y_{T-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^k\\sum_{s=0}^p \\theta_{s,j} X_{T-s,j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhile this is conceptually easy, implementing the steps needed to calculate the forecast is insidious, and care must be taken to ensure we are calculating the correct forecast.\nTo start, it is convenient to rewrite the model in Equation 1 as a linear model \\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\mathbf{u},\n\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is the vector (of size \\(1+(1+p)(1+k)\\)) \\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha\\\\\n\\phi_{0}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\phi_{p}\\\\\n\\theta_{0,1}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\theta_{p,1}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\theta_{1,k}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\theta_{p,k}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) are respectively given by \\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix}\ny_{p+h+1}  \\\\\ny_{p+h+2}\\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny_{T}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\] and \\[\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & Y_{p+1} & Y_{p} & \\cdots & Y_{1} & X_{p+1,1} & X_{p,1} & \\cdots & X_{1,1} & X_{p+1,k} & X_{p,k} & \\cdots & X_{1,k}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots &  & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots &  & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots &  & \\vdots\\\\\n1 & Y_{T-h-1} & Y_{T-h-2} & \\cdots & Y_{T-h-p-1} & X_{T-h-1,1} & X_{T-h-2,1} & \\cdots & X_{T-h-p-1,1} & X_{T-h-1,k} & X_{T-h-2,k} & \\cdots & X_{T-h-p-1,k}\\\\\n1 & Y_{T-h} & Y_{T-h-1} & \\cdots & Y_{T-h-p} & X_{T-h,1} & X_{T-h-1,1} & \\cdots & X_{T-h-p,1} & X_{T-h,k} & X_{T-h-1,k} &  & X_{T-h-p,k}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] The size of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is \\((T-p-h)\\times 1+(1+k)(1+p)\\) and that of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is \\(T-h-p\\).\nThe matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) can be obtained in the following way:\n\nYraw = df_cleaned['INDPRO']\nXraw = df_cleaned[['CPIAUCSL', 'TB3MS']]\n\nnum_lags  = 4  ##

Since INDPRO has been transformed in logarithmic differences, we are forecasting the percentage change (and multiplying by 100 gives the forecast in percentage points).\nTo obtain the \\(h\\)-step ahead forecast, we must repeat all the above steps using a different h.\n\n\nForecasting Exercise\nHow good is the forecast that the model is producing? One thing we could do to assess the forecast’s quality is to wait for the new data on industrial production and see how big the forecasting error is. However, this evaluation would not be appropriate because we need to evaluate the forecast as if it were repeatedly used to forecast future values of the target variables. To properly assess the model and its ability to forecast INDPRO, we must keep producing forecasts and calculating the errors as new data arrive. This procedure would take time as we must wait for many months to have a series of errors that is large enough.\nA different approach is to do what is called a Real-time evaluation. A Real-time evaluation procedure consists of putting ourselves in the shoes of a forecaster who has been using the forecasting model for a long time.\nIn practice, that is what are the steps to follow to do a Real-time evaluation of the model:\n\nSet \\(T\\) such that the last observation of df coincides with December 1999;\nEstimate the model using the data up to \\(T\\)\nProduce \\(\\hat{Y}_{T+1}, \\hat{Y}_{T+2}, \\dots, \\hat{Y}_{T+H}\\)\nSince we have the actual data for January, February, …, we can calculate the forecasting errors of our model \\[\n\\hat{e}_{T+h} = \\hat{Y}_{T+h} - Y_{T+h}, \\,\\, h = 1,\\ldots, H.\n\\]\nSet \\(T = T+1\\) and do all the steps above.\n\nThe process results are a series of forecasting errors we can evaluate using several metrics. The most commonly used is the MSFE, which is defined as \\[\nMSFE_h = \\frac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^J  \\hat{e}_{T+j+h}^2,\n\\] where \\(J\\) is the number of errors we collected through our real-time evaluation.\nThis assignment asks you to perform a real-time evaluation assessment of our simple forecasting model and calculate the MSFE for steps \\(h=1,4,8\\).\nAs a bonus, we can evaluate different models and see how they perform differently. For instance, you might consider different numbers of lags and/or different variables in the model.\n\nHint\nA sensible way to structure the code for real-time evaluation is to use several functions. For instance, you can define a function that calculates the forecast given the DataFrame.\n\ndef calculate_forecast(df_cleaned, p = 4, H = [1,4,8], end_date = '12/1/1999',target = 'INDPRO', xvars = ['CPIAUCSL', 'TB3MS']):\n\n    ## Subset df_cleaned to use only data up to end_date\n    rt_df = df_cleaned[df_cleaned['sasdate'] &lt;= pd.Timestamp(end_date)]\n    ## Get the actual values of target at different steps ahead\n    Y_actual = []\n    for h in H:\n        os = pd.Timestamp(end_date) + pd.DateOffset(months=h)\n        Y_actual.append(df_cleaned[df_cleaned['sasdate'] == os][target]*100)\n        ## Now Y contains the true values at T+H (multiplying * 100)\n\n    Yraw = rt_df[target]\n    Xraw = rt_df[xvars]\n\n    X = pd.DataFrame()\n    ## Add the lagged values of Y\n    for lag in range(0,p):\n        # Shift each column in the DataFrame and name it with a lag suffix\n        X[f'{target}_lag{lag}'] = Yraw.shift(lag)\n\n    for col in Xraw.columns:\n        for lag in range(0,p):\n            X[f'{col}_lag{lag}'] = Xraw[col].shift(lag)\n    \n    ## Add a column on ones (for the intercept)\n    X.insert(0, 'Ones', np.ones(len(X)))\n    \n    ## Save last row of X (converted to numpy)\n    X_T = X.iloc[-1:].values\n\n    ## While the X will be the same, Y needs to be leaded differently\n    Yhat = []\n    for h in H:\n        y_h = Yraw.shift(-h)\n        ## Subset getting only rows of X and y from p+1 to h-1\n        y = y_h.iloc[p:-h].values\n        X_ = X.iloc[p:-h].values\n        # Solving for the OLS estimator beta: (X'X)^{-1} X'Y\n        beta_ols = solve(X_.T @ X_, X_.T @ y)\n        ## Produce the One step ahead forecast\n        ## % change month-to-month INDPRO\n        Yhat.append(X_T@beta_ols*100)\n\n    ## Now calculate the forecasting error and return\n\n    return np.array(Y_actual) - np.array(Yhat)\n\nWith this function, you can calculate real-time errors by looping over the end_date to ensure you end the loop at the right time.\n\nt0 = pd.Timestamp('12/1/1999')\ne = []\nT = []\nfor j in range(0, 10):\n    t0 = t0 + pd.DateOffset(months=1)\n    print(f'Using data up to {t0}')\n    ehat = calculate_forecast(df_cleaned, p = 4, H = [1,4,8], end_date = t0)\n    e.append(ehat.flatten())\n    T.append(t0)\n\n## Create a pandas DataFrame from the list\nedf = pd.DataFrame(e)\n## Calculate the RMSFE, that is, the square root of the MSFE\nnp.sqrt(edf.apply(np.square).mean())\n\nUsing data up to 2000-01-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-02-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-03-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-04-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-05-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-06-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-07-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-08-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-09-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-10-01 00:00:00\n\n\n0    0.337110\n1    0.512690\n2    0.624035\ndtype: float64\n\n\nYou may change the function calculate_forecast to output also the actual data end the forecast, so you can, for instance, construct a plot."

This is where you can quickly access various commands in VSCode.\n\n\nClone Repository\n\n\nIn the Command Palette, type “Git: Clone” and select the option Git: Clone from the list that appears. This action will prompt VSCode to clone a repository.\n\n\nEnter the Repository URL\n\n\nA text box asking for the repository URL will appear at the top of the VSCode window. Enter https://github.com/uniroma/comptools-assignments and press Enter. (This is the URL of the assignment 1 repository).\n\n\nChoose a Directory\n\n\nNext, VSCode will ask you to select a directory where you want to clone the repository. Navigate through your file system and choose a directory that will be the local storage place for the repository. The directory should exist. Create it if it doesn’t. Once selected, the cloning process will start.\n\n\nOpen the Cloned Repository\n\n\nAfter the repository has been successfully cloned, a notification will pop up in the bottom right corner of VSCode with the option to Open Repository. Click on it. If you missed the notification, you can navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open it manually from within VSCode by going to File &gt; Open Folder.\n\n\nStart Working\n\n\nNow that the repository is cloned and opened in VSCode, you can start working on the project. You can edit files, commit changes, and manage branches directly from VSCode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have Git installed on your computer to use the Git features in VSCode. If you do not have Git installed, you can download it from the official Git website. Instructions to install Git.\nIf you are working with GitHub repositories frequently, consider authenticating with GitHub in VSCode to streamline your workflow. This can be done through the Command Palette by finding the GitHub: Sign in command.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake changes and commit them to the repository\n\nMake Your Changes\n\nOpen the repository you have cloned in VSCode.\nNavigate to the file(s) you wish to change within the VSCode Explorer pane.\nMake the necessary modifications or additions to the file(s). These changes can be anything from fixing a bug to adding new features.\n\nReview Your Changes\n\n\nAfter making changes, you can see which files have been modified by looking at the Source Control panel. You can access this panel by clicking on the Source Control icon (it looks like a branch or a fork) on the sidebar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+G (macOS) and searching for Show control panel.\nModified files are listed within the Source Control panel. Click on a file to view the changes (differences) between your working version and the last commit. Lines added are highlighted in green, and lines removed are highlighted in red.\n\n\nStage Your Changes\n\n\nBefore committing, you need to stage your changes. Staging is like preparing and reviewing exactly what changes you will commit to without making the commit final.\nYou can stage changes by right-clicking on a modified file in the Source Control panel and selecting Stage Changes. Alternatively, you can stage all changes at once by clicking the + icon next to the “Changes” header.\n\n\nCommit Your Changes\n\n\nAfter staging your changes, commit them to the repository. To do this, type a commit message in the message box at the top of the Source Control panel. This message should briefly describe the changes you’ve made.\nPress Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Enter (macOS) to commit the staged changes (search for Git: Commit). Alternatively, you can click the checkmark icon (Commit) at the top of the Source Control panel.\nBefore committing, you should enter a commit message that briefly describes the changes that you have made. Commit messages are essential for making the project’s history understandable for yourself and the other collaborators.\n\n\nPush Your Changes\n\n\nIf you’re working with a remote repository (like one hosted on GitHub), you must push your commits to update the remote repository with your local changes.\nYou can push changes by clicking on the three dots (...) menu in the Source Control panel, navigating to Push and selecting it. If you’re using Git in VSCode for the first time, you might be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials or authenticate in another way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s a good practice to pull changes from the remote repository before starting your work session (to ensure you’re working with the latest version) and before pushing your changes (to ensure no conflicts). You can pull changes by clicking on the three dots (...) menu in the Source Control panel and selecting Pull.\n\n\nThe following video explores in more detail how to use git in VSCode."

For unbiasedness, the law of iterated expectations and the iid of \\((u_t,x_t)\\) gives \\[\nE\\left(E\\left(\\hat{\\beta}^{ols}|\\mathbf{X}\\right)\\right)=\\beta^{o}+E\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}'E(U|\\mathbf{X})\\right)=\\beta^{o}.\n\\] Under the iid assumption and the restrictions on the fourth moments of \\(u_t\\) and \\(x_t\\), we have \\[\n\\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{X}'U=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\begin{pmatrix}u_{t}\\\\\nx_{t}u_{t},\n\\end{pmatrix}\\xrightarrow{p}\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix},\\text{ and }\\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & x_{t}\\\\\nx_{t}, & x_{t}^{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\\xrightarrow{p}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & E(x_{t})\\\\\nE(x_{t}), & E(x_{t}^{2})\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] These convergences in probability deliver consistency of the OLS estimator \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}^{ols}=\\beta^{o}+\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{X}'U\\xrightarrow{p}\\beta^{o}+\\begin{pmatrix}1 & E(x_{t})\\\\\nE(x_{t}), & E(x_{t}^{2})\n\\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\beta^{o}.\n\\] Finally, iid, the moments’ restrictions, and the homoskedasticity assumptions, give \\[\n\\sqrt{T}\\left(\\hat{\\beta}^{ols}-\\beta^{o}\\right)\\xrightarrow{d}N\\left[0,\\sigma^{2}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & E(x_{t})\\\\\nE(x_{t}), & E(x_{t}^{2})\n\\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\\right].\n\\]\nConsistency and asymptotic results, and they hold as \\(T\\to\\infty\\). Given a sample of size \\(T\\), say \\(T=50\\), how close is the distribution of \\(\\hat{\\beta}^o\\) the normal one postulated by the usual asymptotic theory? How close is \\(\\hat{\\beta}^o\\) to \\(\\beta^o\\)? Unfortunately, theory only tells us that the larger the sample size, the better the normal approximation. Similarly, it tells us that \\(\\hat{\\beta}^o-\\beta^o\\) is smaller the larger the sample size.\nMonte Carlo simulations can help us determine how good these approximations are for a given size of \\(T\\). The idea is simple: we simulate a sample of \\((u_t, x_t)\\), \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\) from which we generate \\(y_t\\) (using a arbitrary value for \\(\\beta^o_0\\) and \\(\\beta^o_1\\).) We estimate the parameters using the simulated data. We repeat this operation many times, saving the estimated parameters. The saved parameters give the empirical distribution of the OLS estimator and help verify how closely the theory matches the empirical distribution.\nThe following code does a Monte Carlo for the linear model above:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\n# Set parameters\nT = 20\nbeta_0_true = 1\nbeta_1_true = 2\nsigma = 1\nnum_simulations = 10000\n\n# Arrays to store the estimates from each simulation\nbeta_0_estimates = np.zeros(num_simulations)\nbeta_1_estimates = np.zeros(num_simulations)\n\n# Run simulations\nfor i in range(num_simulations):\n    x = np.random.normal(0, 1, T)\n    u = np.random.normal(0, sigma, T)\n    y = beta_0_true + beta_1_true * x + u\n\n    # OLS estimation\n    X = np.vstack([np.ones(T), x]).T\n    beta_hat = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y\n    beta_0_estimates[i] = beta_hat[0]\n    beta_1_estimates[i] = beta_hat[1]\n\n# Plotting the results\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))\n\n# Distribution of beta_0\nax[0].hist(beta_0_estimates, bins=100, alpha=0.5, density=True)\nxmin, xmax = ax[0].get_xlim()\nx = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)\np = norm.pdf(x, beta_0_true, 1/np.sqrt(T))\nax[0].plot(x, p, 'k', linewidth=2)\nax[0].set_title(f'Empirical vs. Normal Approximation for $\\\\hat{{\\\\beta}}_0$')\n\n# Distribution of beta_1\nax[1].hist(beta_1_estimates, bins=100, alpha=0.50, density=True)\nxmin, xmax = ax[1].get_xlim()\nx = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)\np = norm.pdf(x, beta_1_true, 1/np.sqrt(T))\nax[1].plot(x, p, 'k', linewidth=2)\nax[1].set_title(f'Empirical vs. Normal Approximation')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approximation is excellent, even if \\(T=20\\). This might sound surprising since the normal distribution of \\(\\hat{\\beta}^{ols}\\) is normal when \\(T\\) is large. The reason why we get such a close agrement between the empirical distribution of \\(\\hat{\\beta}^{ols}\\) and the theoretical one is that we are simulating \\(u_t\\) the data from a normal distribution independently from \\(x_t\\). When \\(u_t|x_t\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\), the distribution of the OLS estimator is precisely normal, even when \\(T=3\\). Of course, if \\(T\\) is small, the estimator’s variance will be larger, but the shape of the distribution of the OLS will be normal.\nInstead of squinting at the histograms and the density implied by the CLT, we can modify the code to calculate the confidence interval at each simulation and see how many times the true values of the parameters fall into all the intervals generated. If the approximation is good, a 95% confidence interval should contain the true parameters 95% of the time.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\n# Set parameters\nT = 50\nbeta_0_true = 1\nbeta_1_true = 2\nsigma = 1\nnum_simulations = 10000\n\n# Arrays to store the estimates from each simulation\nbeta_0_estimates = np.zeros(num_simulations)\nbeta_1_estimates = np.zeros(num_simulations)\nbeta_0_in = np.zeros(num_simulations)\nbeta_1_in = np.zeros(num_simulations)\n\n# Run simulations\nfor i in range(num_simulations):\n    x = np.random.normal(0,1,T)\n    u = np.random.normal(0,sigma,T)\n    y = beta_0_true + beta_1_true * x + u\n    # OLS estimation\n    X = np.vstack([np.ones(T), x]).T\n    XXinv = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X)\n    beta_hat = XXinv @ X.T @ y\n    beta_0_estimates[i] = beta_hat[0]\n    beta_1_estimates[i] = beta_hat[1]\n    u_hat = y - beta_hat[0] - beta_hat[1] * x\n    sigma2_hat = np.dot(u_hat, u_hat)/(T-2)\n    variance_hat = sigma2_hat*XXinv\n    se_0 = np.sqrt(variance_hat[0,0])\n    se_1 = np.sqrt(variance_hat[1,1])\n    ## Check weather beta_0 in CI 95%\n    beta_0_in[i] = beta_hat[0] - 1.965*se_0 &lt; beta_0_true &lt; beta_hat[0] + 1.965*se_0\n    beta_1_in[i] = beta_hat[1] - 1.965*se_1 &lt; beta_1_true &lt; beta_hat[1] + 1.965*se_1\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"Empirical 95% CI for beta_0: {np.mean(beta_0_in)}\")\nprint(f\"Empirical 95% CI for beta_1: {np.mean(beta_1_in)}\")\n\nEmpirical 95% CI for beta_0: 0.9448\nEmpirical 95% CI for beta_1: 0.949\n\n\nThe empirical coverage of the confidence intervals is only in the neighborhood of 95%.

Unfortunately, with time-dependent data, the bootstrap needs to be modified. Instead of sampling with replacement observations from \\(y_t\\) and \\(x_t\\), we will sample blocks of length \\(\\ell\\) with replacement. By resampling blocks, we ensure that the correlation in the data is preserved.\nThe moving block bootstrap (MBB) adapts the traditional bootstrap method to handle data where observations are dependent, such as in time series analysis. This approach involves resampling consecutive observation blocks to preserve the data’s internal structure and dependence.\n\nSteps for Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB):\n\nChoose Block Length: Determine the length of the blocks, \\(\\ell\\), that will be resampled. This length should be chosen based on the correlation structure of the data: the block length should be large enough to capture the dependence within the data.\nGenerate Blocks: From the original dataset of size \\(T\\), generate new datasets by sampling blocks of length \\(\\ell\\) and concatenate them until reaching the size \\(T\\). Blocks should be sampled with replacement.\nResample Data within Blocks: Sample \\(y_t\\) and \\(x_t\\) using the sampled blocks.

    "text": "Forecasting in Time Series\nForecasting in time series analysis involves using historical data to predict future values. The objective is to model the conditional expectation of a time series based on past observations.\n\nDirect Forecasts\nDirect forecasting involves modeling the target variable directly at the desired forecast horizon. Unlike iterative approaches, which forecast one step ahead and then use those forecasts as inputs for subsequent steps, direct forecasting directly models the relationship between past observations and future value.\n\n\nARX Models\nAutoregressive Moving with predictors (ARX) models are a class of univariate time series models that extend ARMA models by incorporating exogenous (independent) variables. These models are formulated as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{t+h} &=  \\alpha + \\phi_0 Y_t + \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p Y_{t-p} + \\theta_{0,1} X_{t,1} + \\theta_{1,1} X_{t-1,1} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,1} X_{t-p,1} + \\dots + \\theta_{0,k} X_{t,k} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,k} X_{t-p,k} + u_{t+h}\\\\\n        &=  \\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^p \\phi_i Y_{t-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^k\\sum_{s=0}^p \\theta_{s,j} X_{t-s,j} + \\epsilon_{t+h}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\\(Y_{t+h}\\): The target variable at time \\(t+h\\).\n\\(X_{t,j}\\): Predictors (variable \\(j=1,\\ldots,k\\) at time \\(t\\)).\n\\(p\\) number of lags of the target and the predictors.1\n\\(\\phi_i\\), \\(i=0,\\dots,p\\), and \\(\\theta_{j,s}\\), \\(j=1,\\dots,k\\), \\(s=1,\\ldots,r\\): Parameters of the model.\n\\(\\epsilon_{t+h}\\): error term.\n\nFor instance, to predict Industrial Prediction using as predictor inflation and the 3-month t-bill, the target variable is INDPRO, and the predictors are CPIAUSL and TB3MS. Notice that the target and the predictors are the transformed variables. Thus, if we use INDPRO as the target, we are predicting the log-difference of industrial production, which is a good approximation for its month-to-month percentage change.\nBy convention, the data ranges from \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\), where \\(T\\) is the last period, we have data (for the df_cleaned dataset, \\(T\\) corresponds to January 2024).\n\n\nForecasting with ARX\nSuppose that we know the parameters of the model for the moment. To obtain a forecast for \\(Y_{T+h}\\), the \\(h\\)-step ahead forecast, we calculate \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{Y}_{T+h} &=  \\alpha + \\phi_0 Y_T + \\phi_1 Y_{T-1} + \\dots + \\phi_p Y_{T-p} \\\\\n                  &\\,\\,\\quad \\quad + \\theta_{0,1} X_{T,1} + \\theta_{1,1} X_{T-1,1} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,1} X_{T-p,1} \\\\\n                  &\\,\\,\\quad \\quad + \\dots + \\theta_{0,k} X_{T,k} + \\dots + \\theta_{p,k} X_{T-p,k}\\\\\n        &=  \\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^p \\phi_i Y_{T-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^k\\sum_{s=0}^p \\theta_{s,j} X_{T-s,j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhile this is conceptually easy, implementing the steps needed to calculate the forecast is insidious, and care must be taken to ensure we are calculating the correct forecast.\nTo start, it is convenient to rewrite the model in Equation 1 as a linear model \\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\mathbf{u},\n\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is the vector (of size \\(1+(1+p)(1+k)\\)) \\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha\\\\\n\\phi_{0}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\phi_{p}\\\\\n\\theta_{0,1}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\theta_{p,1}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\theta_{1,k}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\theta_{p,k}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) are respectively given by \\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix}\ny_{p+h+1}  \\\\\ny_{p+h+2}\\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny_{T}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\] and \\[\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & Y_{p+1} & Y_{p} & \\cdots & Y_{1} & X_{p+1,1} & X_{p,1} & \\cdots & X_{1,1} & X_{p+1,k} & X_{p,k} & \\cdots & X_{1,k}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots &  & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots &  & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots &  & \\vdots\\\\\n1 & Y_{T-h-1} & Y_{T-h-2} & \\cdots & Y_{T-h-p-1} & X_{T-h-1,1} & X_{T-h-2,1} & \\cdots & X_{T-h-p-1,1} & X_{T-h-1,k} & X_{T-h-2,k} & \\cdots & X_{T-h-p-1,k}\\\\\n1 & Y_{T-h} & Y_{T-h-1} & \\cdots & Y_{T-h-p} & X_{T-h,1} & X_{T-h-1,1} & \\cdots & X_{T-h-p,1} & X_{T-h,k} & X_{T-h-1,k} &  & X_{T-h-p,k}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] The size of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is \\((T-p-h)\\times 1+(1+k)(1+p)\\) and that of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is \\(T-h-p\\).\nThe matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) can be obtained in the following way:\n\nYraw = df_cleaned['INDPRO']\nXraw = df_cleaned[['CPIAUCSL', 'TB3MS']]\n\nnum_lags  = 4  ##

Since INDPRO has been transformed in logarithmic differences, we are forecasting the percentage change (and multiplying by 100 gives the forecast in percentage points).\nTo obtain the \\(h\\)-step ahead forecast, we must repeat all the above steps using a different h.\n\n\nForecasting Exercise\nHow good is the forecast that the model is producing? One thing we could do to assess the forecast’s quality is to wait for the new data on industrial production and see how big the forecasting error is. However, this evaluation would not be appropriate because we need to evaluate the forecast as if it were repeatedly used to forecast future values of the target variables. To properly assess the model and its ability to forecast INDPRO, we must keep producing forecasts and calculating the errors as new data arrive. This procedure would take time as we must wait for many months to have a series of errors that is large enough.\nA different approach is to do what is called a Real-time evaluation. A Real-time evaluation procedure consists of putting ourselves in the shoes of a forecaster who has been using the forecasting model for a long time.\nIn practice, that is what are the steps to follow to do a Real-time evaluation of the model:\n\nSet \\(T\\) such that the last observation of df coincides with December 1999;\nEstimate the model using the data up to \\(T\\)\nProduce \\(\\hat{Y}_{T+1}, \\hat{Y}_{T+2}, \\dots, \\hat{Y}_{T+H}\\)\nSince we have the actual data for January, February, …, we can calculate the forecasting errors of our model \\[\n\\hat{e}_{T+h} = \\hat{Y}_{T+h} - Y_{T+h}, \\,\\, h = 1,\\ldots, H.\n\\]\nSet \\(T = T+1\\) and do all the steps above.\n\nThe process results are a series of forecasting errors we can evaluate using several metrics. The most commonly used is the MSFE, which is defined as \\[\nMSFE_h = \\frac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^J  \\hat{e}_{T+j+h}^2,\n\\] where \\(J\\) is the number of errors we collected through our real-time evaluation.\nThis assignment asks you to perform a real-time evaluation assessment of our simple forecasting model and calculate the MSFE for steps \\(h=1,4,8\\).\nAs a bonus, we can evaluate different models and see how they perform differently. For instance, you might consider different numbers of lags and/or different variables in the model.\n\nHint\nA sensible way to structure the code for real-time evaluation is to use several functions. For instance, you can define a function that calculates the forecast given the DataFrame.\n\ndef calculate_forecast(df_cleaned, p = 4, H = [1,4,8], end_date = '12/1/1999',target = 'INDPRO', xvars = ['CPIAUCSL', 'TB3MS']):\n\n    ## Subset df_cleaned to use only data up to end_date\n    rt_df = df_cleaned[df_cleaned['sasdate'] &lt;= pd.Timestamp(end_date)]\n    ## Get the actual values of target at different steps ahead\n    Y_actual = []\n    for h in H:\n        os = pd.Timestamp(end_date) + pd.DateOffset(months=h)\n        Y_actual.append(df_cleaned[df_cleaned['sasdate'] == os][target]*100)\n        ## Now Y contains the true values at T+H (multiplying * 100)\n\n    Yraw = rt_df[target]\n    Xraw = rt_df[xvars]\n\n    X = pd.DataFrame()\n    ## Add the lagged values of Y\n    for lag in range(0,p):\n        # Shift each column in the DataFrame and name it with a lag suffix\n        X[f'{target}_lag{lag}'] = Yraw.shift(lag)\n\n    for col in Xraw.columns:\n        for lag in range(0,p):\n            X[f'{col}_lag{lag}'] = Xraw[col].shift(lag)\n    \n    ## Add a column on ones (for the intercept)\n    X.insert(0, 'Ones', np.ones(len(X)))\n    \n    ## Save last row of X (converted to numpy)\n    X_T = X.iloc[-1:].values\n\n    ## While the X will be the same, Y needs to be leaded differently\n    Yhat = []\n    for h in H:\n        y_h = Yraw.shift(-h)\n        ## Subset getting only rows of X and y from p+1 to h-1\n        y = y_h.iloc[p:-h].values\n        X_ = X.iloc[p:-h].values\n        # Solving for the OLS estimator beta: (X'X)^{-1} X'Y\n        beta_ols = solve(X_.T @ X_, X_.T @ y)\n        ## Produce the One step ahead forecast\n        ## % change month-to-month INDPRO\n        Yhat.append(X_T@beta_ols*100)\n\n    ## Now calculate the forecasting error and return\n\n    return np.array(Y_actual) - np.array(Yhat)\n\nWith this function, you can calculate real-time errors by looping over the end_date to ensure you end the loop at the right time.\n\nt0 = pd.Timestamp('12/1/1999')\ne = []\nT = []\nfor j in range(0, 10):\n    t0 = t0 + pd.DateOffset(months=1)\n    print(f'Using data up to {t0}')\n    ehat = calculate_forecast(df_cleaned, p = 4, H = [1,4,8], end_date = t0)\n    e.append(ehat.flatten())\n    T.append(t0)\n\n## Create a pandas DataFrame from the list\nedf = pd.DataFrame(e)\n## Calculate the RMSFE, that is, the square root of the MSFE\nnp.sqrt(edf.apply(np.square).mean())\n\nUsing data up to 2000-01-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-02-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-03-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-04-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-05-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-06-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-07-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-08-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-09-01 00:00:00\nUsing data up to 2000-10-01 00:00:00\n\n\n0    0.337110\n1    0.512690\n2    0.624035\ndtype: float64\n\n\nYou may change the function calculate_forecast to output also the actual data end the forecast, so you can, for instance, construct a plot."
